# CUBSAT
The cubesat is a nano satellite that helps us to monitor parameters on space ,it will monitor the Weather , Cosmic radiation , Earthâ€™s magnetic field etc.....
# ABSTRACT
A CubeSat is a small satellite with a form factor of 10 cm (3.9 in) cubes, weighing no more than 2 kg (4.4 lb) per unit. These miniaturized satellites often use commercial off-the-shelf components for their electronics and structure. CubeSats are deployed into orbit from the International Space Station or launched as secondary payloads. They serve purposes such as Earth observation, amateur radio, and technology demonstrations. The CubeSat standard has encouraged engineering collaboration, student training, and scientific research.
